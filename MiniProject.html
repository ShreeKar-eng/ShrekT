        <h1>FC Barcelona</h1>
        <p>Football Club Barcelona, abbr. FCB or FC Barcelona is one of the best teams in the history. While in the shadow of its arch rival in the 20th century, with the arrival of former club legend Johan Cryuff as the manager, the club has not looked back. Immediately after his appointment, Barcelona lifted its first ever European Trophy. While it would be more than a decade later that they would win their next Eurpoean honors, the foundation for the greatest team ever was laid during the legendary Dutch wizard's tenure.</p>
        <p>Pep Guardiola, the captain of Cryuff's dream team, followed in the footsteps of his mentor, as he returned to the club as its manager. But before his arrival, the club had its few ups and downs. They got relegated to the Europa League and finished outside of top 4 in occasions. All was not gloomy though as they were able to attract a few big names in world football. Luis Figo, Deco and several other great names made their way to the top. The battering was back and forth against their nemesis. Plenty of great players had represented Barcelona in the past, including the names like Cryuff himself, Diego Maradona, Romario, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Koeman, among other great Spainsh players of the era. But it was the arrival of Ronaldinho that changed the club forever. Mesmerizing the Bernabeu crowd en route to a brace and 3-0 victory over Real Madrid, Ronaldinho announced that Barcelona now meant business. He was able to inspire the team to its second ever Champions League title in 2006, while also winning the balon d'or.</p>
        <p>Frank Rijkaard had taken the team to an unforeseen height, but as with everything, his time had come. Pep guardiola arrived at the Camp Nou in the summer of 2008, and was immediately taken to the sword as he was not able to bring in victoriesin his first three Liga matches. Things turned around after that though. It was evident that Guardiola meant business right from the word go, as he had off shored the greats like Ronaldinho and Deco, who he felt might have had bad influneces in the youngsters. It didn't take much long for the team to start functioning like a well oiled engine. As with any Guardiola team, it was the band that performed and it was never a solo performance. Even amidst that, a talent shone so bright, that he stood apart from the rest, and by a fair distance. We've seen stars rising in a Guardiola team, de Bryune, Lahm, Lewandowski, Ribery and Robben, Xavi and Iniesta, but none stood out quite like the great Lionel Messi</p>
        <p>Messi would go on to become the greatest player in the Club history. The dominace in the El Clasicos, the number of league titles and surreal Champions League have taken him to the debate of the greatest footballer of time. </p>
        <p>With the departure of Lionel Messi, the club went on to a whole of shambles. The early exit from the Champions League got the manager Ronald Koeman axed. However, the arrival of another club legend, Xavi has aired in a fresh breath of hope. The club has started seems to have rediscovered its identity and the future is looking bright for the blaugrana</p>
